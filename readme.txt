= Why Should I Use This Plugin? =

vWriter.com's **[Guest Post Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/vwriter-guest-post/)** gives you all the benefits of guest posting but without all the usual hassle and hard work. 

Guest posting is one of the most effective online marketing strategies you can use - for example:

* It's highly effective for SEO, giving you the type of links Google fully supports and loves ...

* It builds long-term, quality, targeted traffic - a visitor who clicks through to your site from a blog post tends to [stick around a lot longer](http://www.writersincharge.com/10-major-benefits-of-guest-blogging/) than traffic from elsewhere ...

* It opens up new business opportunities and helps develop powerful relationships with key players in your industry ...

* It boosts your online influence, authority, and social media following ...

* And more ...

Instead of you having to do all the work, *the blog owners come to you*, saving you all the hassle, and hours and hours of lost time ... the plugin largely automates the whole guest posting process for you

= So How Does It Work? =

Visitors to your blog can request a 100% unique, professionally-written version of your blog post they can then publish as a Guest Post on their blog with link(s) back to your site.

After installing the plugin, a simple piece of text and a link appears at the end of all your posts ... or just the posts you choose. 

Features include:

* The ability to define the text (including the link text) that appears at the end of your posts

* Option to have the text and link appear at the end of all posts, or just the posts you choose

Plus, the plugin is fully integrated with [vWriter.com](http://www.vwriter.com):

* Fully streamlined process for bloggers wanting to publish your Guest Post on their blog.

* Instant notification when a blogger requests your Guest Post - we verify their ownership of their blog so you know their request is genuine.

* With each request, you decide whether to approve or decline - maintain control over exactly which sites will be publishing your content and linking to you.

* The blogger suggests the word count they would like for the Guest Post - you can then agree, or negotiate further with them via our messaging system.

* For Guest Post requests you approve, a writer is automatically commissioned to professionally rewrite the blog post for you, which is added as a new order to your vWriter.com account (register here for free if you don't yet have an account).

* Set the bio box (and optional profile picture) you want to appear at the end of the Guest Posts that are published, and which will link back to you ... use the plugin for as many blogs as you wish, and define a separate bio for each.

* Once the content for the Guest Post has been written and you've approved it (again, you have full control):

 * The blogger is notified and, to allow for their publishing schedule, they have thirty days to publish your Guest Post and notify us of its publication (we send them appropriate reminders during this time).

 * As soon as they notify us they have published your Guest Post, we send you the link where it's published.

If on the rare occasion the blog owner does not publish within the required time frame:

* They lose any right to publish (you own the copyright, whether or not they publish it)

* They are notified accordingly and may be banned from making future such requests

* The content is reserved in your account to meet a future such Guest Post request instead ... or you can use it for something else (for example, communicating with your list, posting to a forum or other site, social media, etc.).


All in all, our Guest Post Plugin means you can start taking advantage of guest posting in an easy and hassle-free way, and is essential for any business owner wanting to build online traffic and visibility in a sustainable way for the long-term.

It's a quick, five minute installation process - just scroll back up, click the Installation tab and follow the simple instructions provided. 

= Feedback =

* I am open to all feedback and suggestions for improvements, thank you for using or trying out this plugin - please just [get in touch](http://support.takanomi.com) or [leave a comment](http://blog.vwriter.com/guest-post-plugin).


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire vwriter-guest-post folder to the '/wp-content/plugins' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress

3. Go to *Settings > vWriter Guest Post* on the menu in Wordpress, and follow the instructions to set the required information - the vWriter.com Client ID that you will need to enter is available by [clicking here](https://clients.vwriter.com/guestpostplugin.php) (login required - if you don't yet have a vWriter.com account, [register here](https://clients.vwriter.com/register.php) for free).

4. [Add a new blog](https://clients.vwriter.com/blog.php) to your vWriter.com account and authorize it to use the plugin - to authorize it, you need to simply define the bio box you want to be published at the end of any guest posts (an example is provided), including a profile picture (optional, but recommended). You can use the plugin for as many blogs as you want. *Please ensure you authorize your blog in this way to use the plugin - otherwise other bloggers won't be able to request a version of your blog post.*

5. Via *Settings > vWriter Guest Post* again, you can set the Scope - this allows you to choose whether to add the guest post link to all your posts, or not. We recommend you turn this on for maximum guest posting opportunities, but if you choose not to, you can add the guest post link for individual posts via the *Edit Post* page. 



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Do I Know The Guest Post Requests Are Genuine? =

* Requests can only come through from blogs you have authorized and registered with us via your [vWriter.com account](https://clients.vwriter.com/login.php) ([register](https://clients.vwriter.com/register.php)).

* Bloggers have to verify ownership of the blog on which they intend to publish your Guest Post - this is quick and simple, ensures the requests are genuine, and helps prevent time wasters and tyre kickers.
* You decide whether to authorize the request or not - you remain in complete control.


= Who Pays For The Guest Post Content? =

You pay for the original post to be rewritten by a professional writer, enabling the whole process to be quick, simple and pain free. For a small investment in the content, you get invaluable links to your site, and all the other benefits guest posting gives you.

For the prospective publisher, it is completely free - this means you attract the maximum amount of interest and potential links for your site. You also maintain full control over which blogs publish your content, by choosing which Guest Post requests to approve.

= What's Wrong With Traditional Guest Posting? =

There's nothing wrong with traditional guest posting, and it's widely recognized as one of the most powerful online marketing strategies you can use.

However, for all the benefit, it is also recognized as requiring a lot of time and hard work both finding suitable blogs which may accept your guest posts, and then attempting to build a relationship with the blog owner so that they may at some point accept a Guest Post from you.

vWriter.com's [Guest Post Plugin](http://www.vwriter.com/guestpostplugin.php) gives you a far more time-efficient and easy solution, with the whole process largely automated for you ... it's a no-brainer for any business owner who has a blog and wants all the advantages of guest posting, but without all the usual hassles and hard work.

That said, there's no reason why you can't do traditional guest posting as well.

= Is It 'Google-Safe'? =

It's not only safe, it's highly beneficial, recommended, and fully in line with Google's guidelines: 

* You're not paying for any links, which is against their Webmaster Guidelines - you're simply providing a unique, professionally-written Guest Post for an individual blogger to publish.

* It's not part of any automated link building scheme, which again is against their Webmaster Guidelines ... the links build up gradually and completely naturally. The plugin simply allows you to attract suitable blogs which you can then Guest Post on in an individualized way, giving you exactly the type of link building Google encourages and recommends.

* The links you get back will be mostly from sites within your own industry, and therefore highly relevant and of high value ... ultimately it's completely up to you to decide which blogs you want to Guest Post on and link back to your site.

* Your links will come from high quality content, written by professional writers, on quality blogs you approve of - you maintain full control at all times.

In summary, there are no gimmicks or shady SEO practices involved, it's all completely above board and in line with practices Google approves of and recommends. The links you get back are exactly the type of links Google and other search engines want to see in determining the value of your site and ranking it accordingly.

= What If I Don't Have A Blog? =

Unfortunately, if you don't have a blog, you not only won't be able to use this plugin, but you are also missing out on what could be an extremely effective marketing strategy for your website.

[Content marketing](http://blog.vwriter.com/) is one of the most effective forms of online marketing, and having your own blog where you can publish your own content on a regular basis to inspire, inform and educate your community is central to that, including allowing you to tap more effectively into social media channels.

Of course, you don't have to create all the content yourself - [vWriter.com](http://www.vwriter.com/) can help create all that content for you on a regular, ongoing basis.

= How Can I Be Sure The Blogger Will Publish The Content? =

 Once you have approved the content that's been written for the Guest Post, the blogger (i.e. the prospective publisher) is immediately notified and provided with the content ready for them to publish on their blog.

They are requested to publish your Guest Post on their blog and notify us accordingly (by providing us with the link) within thirty days.

We automatically send them helpful reminders during this time at appropriate intervals to ensure they don't forget to do so.

As soon as we are notified of publication, we'll send you the link so you can see your published Guest Post!

In the rare occurrence that they fail to publish it, their right to do so is revoked, we let them know accordingly, and they may be prevented from making further requests.

We then reserve the Guest Post content in your vWriter.com account so it is available to immediately supply a future Guest Post request for the same original post on your blog. Alternatively, you can choose to release the content and have it available for your own purposes if you wish.
